This script performs a comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing on a dataset of used cars. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1) Downloads and Loads Data:

-Downloads a CSV file from a URL and saves it as "usedcars.csv"

-Reads the CSV into a pandas DataFrame with custom column headers

2) Handles Missing Data:

-Replaces '?' with NaN values

-Identifies missing data in each column

-Imputes missing values with column means for numerical columns:

normalized-losses , bore , horsepower , peak-rpm , stroke

-Replaces missing 'num-of-doors' with the most frequent value ('four')

-Drops rows with missing price values

3) Data Type Conversion:

- Converts columns to appropriate data types (float, int)

4) Feature Engineering:

-Converts mpg to L/100km for both city and highway mileage

-Normalizes length, width, and height by dividing by their maximum values

5) Data Binning:

-Bins horsepower into three categories (Low, Medium, High)

-Creates visualizations of the horsepower distribution before and after binning

6) Categorical Variable Handling:

-Creates dummy variables for the 'fuel-type' column (gas/diesel)

-Concatenates these dummy variables with the original DataFrame

-Drops the original 'fuel-type' column

7) Output:

-Shows the DataFrame head at various stages

-Displays data types

-Creates visualizations of the data distribution
